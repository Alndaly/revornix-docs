# Revornix-v0.3.0-beta1

<Callout type='warning'>
	This version belongs to the 0.3.0-beta series. It contains many incomplete and experimental features. For testing only — **DO NOT** use in production!
</Callout>

## Upgrade from Previous Versions

**This update is a breaking change. The file system design is incompatible with earlier versions. Please back up your existing file system data before upgrading** (typically located in the `volumes/files` folder if you're an older user — see the image below for reference ⬇️). After upgrading, you'll need to re-import your data.

How to import your old documents: First, compress and save your old documents locally (**make sure to keep the original file structure intact** — do not move or rename anything!). A script will be provided in the official release of v0.3.0 to help you import your old documents into the new file system easily.

~Of course, if you're willing to try it yourself, feel free to do so. Just remember to back up your files. The migration itself isn't too complex — it just requires some patience to carefully compare the file system code between versions.~

## What's New

- The control panel now features quick setup options, making it easier for new users to configure and start using the app.
- Added alerts in the control panel to show which parameters are still unset, with quick links to jump directly to the corresponding settings — significantly reducing confusion for new users.
- Redesigned document detail page for a cleaner, more intuitive experience.
- Support for customizable reading completion reasons (e.g., viewed details, scrolled to bottom, or marked manually).
- Replaced the old built-in file system stack with MinIO for better performance and structure.
- Added support for custom file systems — currently only Alibaba OSS and built-in MinIO are supported. More options will be available in the official v0.3.0 release.
- Various bug fixes.
- Codebase optimizations.
