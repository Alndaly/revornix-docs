# Revornix v0.4.1-beta1

> It's late again~ Things have been super busy, but I finally managed to get this version out!

This release is one of the beta versions leading up to the official v0.4 release. Expect 1–2 more betas before the final version.

⚠️ **This update includes some breaking changes. Please read carefully.**

**All previously generated vectors will no longer be compatible. Please re-upload documents if needed.**

For now, please continue using local packaging to start the project.

## 🔍 Highlights

- **Public column access page added**  
  Users can now browse specified columns and related open data without logging in — making it easier to share knowledge openly.

- **Document editing support added**  
  Users can now edit the documents they created (some fields only).

- **GraphRAG and Knowledge Graph visualization added**  
  This one was *really* hard — took me a long time to get it working!
