# Revornix-v0.0.3

After several days of hard work, we're excited to announce the release of **Revornix v0.0.3**! This version brings many improvements and fixes to enhance your experience.

## Update Highlights

- Added a mechanism to switch between the default Revornix AI response model and document reader model. You can now freely choose models within the app without needing to predefine them in environment variables!
- Fixed a number of known issues, including (but not limited to) AI summarization, hot search aggregation, and Docker build workflows.
