# Revornix-v0.6.2

## Highlights

- Improved workflow design with a soft task cancellation mechanism to reduce resource waste.
- Optimized file architecture: all file repositories in use are now private to prevent full-repo leaks.
- Refactored the notification system: notification sources and targets can now be made public for community use. Notification records are bound to notification tasks for easier tracking, helping reduce abuse of the community notification system.
- Strengthened the encryption system: all key configuration data stored in Postgres is now encrypted.
- Optimized Postgres database connections.
- Fixed some known issues.
