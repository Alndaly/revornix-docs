# Revornix-v0.3.0-beta2

<Callout type='warning'>
	This version belongs to the 0.3.0-beta series and contains many incomplete and to-be-improved features. For testing and experience only—**do not use in production environments**!
</Callout>

## Upgrade from version 0.2.*

**This is a breaking update. The file system and previous designs are not compatible. Please back up your original file system data before upgrading. (If you're an old user, this is likely the `volumes/files` folder. See image below for reference ⬇️) After upgrading, you will need to re-import your data.**

How to import previous documents: Please compress and archive the original documents locally (make sure to **preserve the original folder structure**—do not modify it!!!). A script will be provided when the official 0.3.0 version is released to help you quickly import your original documents into the new file system.

~Of course, if you're up for the challenge, feel free to try migrating yourself. Just be sure to back everything up. In fact, the migration itself isn't that complex—it just requires some patience to understand the differences between the two versions' file systems.~

## Highlights

- Optimized interaction logic related to document parsing engine configuration.
- Fixed numerous bugs, improved parts of the codebase, and enhanced stability.
