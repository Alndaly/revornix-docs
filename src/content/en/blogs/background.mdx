# Project Background

In this era of increasingly complex information, each of us is bombarded with countless pieces of information every day. From news and social media to work emails and text notifications, we are constantly surrounded by various types of information. While the spread of information has brought convenience to our lives, it has also made us feel the pressure of information overload. We often get lost in our busy schedules, finding it difficult to effectively filter and process truly valuable content. Too much irrelevant information not only wastes our time but also creates anxiety and distress in our work, study, and life.

I deeply realize that, faced with such a vast amount of information, we must find an effective way to manage it. The accumulation of information itself is not the problem; the problem lies in how we filter, categorize, and quickly access useful information. It is precisely because of this need that I decided to start this project, hoping to help people better manage information through innovative methods, thereby improving their quality of life and work efficiency.

Through conversations with friends and colleagues, I discovered that many people are troubled by information overload. Whether at work or in study and life, the daily influx of notifications, meetings, courses, etc., not only makes us feel overwhelmed but also easily leads to missing important details and tasks. In our personal lives, the constant updates on social media often drown us in information streams, making it difficult to focus on content that is truly meaningful to us. Despite the emergence of many information management tools and applications, most cannot truly solve the needs for personalized and intelligent management.

Therefore, I decided to develop a brand-new platform aimed at helping users manage information in a more intelligent and efficient way. This platform is not just a simple information storage tool, but a system that integrates intelligent recommendation and personalized filtering functions. It combines AI to automatically organize and categorize information based on users' needs and interests, providing the most relevant content and reducing redundancy and unnecessary distractions. Whether it's materials that need to be quickly retrieved for work or news and articles of interest in daily life, they can all be easily managed and accessed through this platform.

I believe that this project can not only help people better manage their digital information but also help them improve the efficiency and quality of processing information, allowing them to find their own rhythm in the complex information flow. In the age of information explosion, everyone should have their own information management tool, and the goal of this tool is to help users find true value and meaning in this world of information overflow.

This is also my original intention for starting this project—to help people better manage their information, improve the quality of life and work, and enable them to navigate the sea of information without getting lost, but rather to easily face each day's challenges.
