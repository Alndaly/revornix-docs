From the `0.4.1-beta` series, this project supports automatic generation of knowledge graphs.

The process is fully automatic. All you need to do is add documents to Revornix, and the knowledge graph will be generated automatically. Of course, this requires some time because Revornix needs to parse the documents and generate the knowledge graph.
