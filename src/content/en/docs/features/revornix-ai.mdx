This project comes with built-in document vectorization.

Leveraging this feature, we’ve developed AI interactions based on entire documents. You can use Revornix to ask the AI any questions related to your documents. Please ensure that you’ve configured the default Revornix response model in the settings.

Note: Currently, we have not developed a built-in online search feature. If you wish to use online search capabilities, you’ll need to manually configure a model endpoint in Volcano Engine that supports online search. This feature is planned to be integrated into the product via MCP in future updates.
