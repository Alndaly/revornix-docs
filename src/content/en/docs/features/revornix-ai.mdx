This project integrates document vectorization and an MCP client/server.

Based on that, Revornix AI can think proactively and interact with your documents. It can also interact with any MCP-compatible service by adding MCP server interfaces.

Of course, this requires configuring models and MCP servers in Settings. (This may be a bit tedious for some users, so I plan to add one-click configuration in a future release.)
