This project comes with built-in support for document vectorization and an MCP client/server.

Thanks to this, Revornix AI is capable of actively thinking and interacting with your documents.
It can also communicate with any other MCP-compatible service by adding corresponding MCP Server interfaces.

Of course, all of this requires you to first configure a model and an MCP Server in the settings page.
(Since this step might be a bit cumbersome for some users, I plan to add a one-click configuration option in a future release.)
