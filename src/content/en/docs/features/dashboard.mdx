We've integrated most basic information into the dashboard page, making it easy for you to quickly understand your document collection status.

On this page, you can get an overview of your current document collection situation. For example, how many unread documents you have, how many documents you've bookmarked, your document and column labels, and your document collection activity over the past month.
