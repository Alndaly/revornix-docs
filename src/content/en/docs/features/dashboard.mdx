# Dashboard

<Callout>
Since the data is real-time, any document that is deleted will not be included in the statistics and will no longer appear on this page.

Most of the systemâ€™s core information is available on the dashboard so you can access it quickly. I will continue migrating additional content to this page over time with more refined logic and UI layout.

If you are a **new user**, you will find onboarding tasks at the top of the dashboard, such as binding models and configuring engines.
