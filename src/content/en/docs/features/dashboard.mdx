# Dashboard

In this version, I’ve migrated some core foundational information into the Dashboard page. This allows you to quickly and easily get an overview of your current knowledge coverage. Moving forward, I’ll continue to bring more content into the dashboard through thoughtful logic and UI layout improvements.

The current data covered includes:

- Daily document collection statistics
- Number of unread documents
- Total documents read recently
- Number of documents bookmarked
- Tags across documents and columns

Since the data is real-time, any document that is deleted will not be included in the statistics and will no longer appear on this page.
