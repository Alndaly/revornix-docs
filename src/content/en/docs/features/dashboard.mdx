# Dashboard

Most core information in the system can be viewed quickly on the dashboard. In future development, I will gradually move more content to the dashboard with better logic and UI layout.

If you are a **new user**, you will also see a to-do list at the top of the dashboard, such as model binding and engine configuration.

Because the data is real-time, once a document is deleted it will not be included in statistics and will not appear on this page.
