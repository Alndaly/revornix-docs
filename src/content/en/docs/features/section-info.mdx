# Sections

The goal of sections is to better integrate your knowledge base and make it easier to **summarize, absorb, and share** knowledge. In practice, it forms an active AI workflow combined with human participation.

## Document binding

A section can be seen as a **specific collection of knowledge**. The design philosophy is to make knowledge **summarization, absorption, and sharing** easier.

Therefore, sections are tightly bound to documents. Once a document is bound to a section, the document appears in the section and the section appears in the document.

There are two ways to bind them. One is to choose a section when creating a document. The other is to open the section details page, click the Documents button, and add documents in the popup.
