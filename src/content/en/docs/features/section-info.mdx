# Sections

Sections are designed to make knowledge bases easier to curate so you can **summarize, absorb, and share** what you know. They blend proactive AI assistance with human contribution.

## Document Binding

A section represents a **curated knowledge set** with the same goals: **summarizing, absorbing, and sharing**.

Sections are tightly coupled with documents. Once a document is linked to a section, it appears in the section view and the section appears in the document details.

You can bind them in two ways: choose a target section when creating a document, or open the section details page, click **Documents**, and use **Add Document** in the dialog.

	To link documents, you must be the section creator or hold full/read-write permissions. Subscribers and read-only collaborators cannot modify section bindings.

In the section details page, the **Documents** button lists every linked document. Inside a document, the **Info** section shows all its associated sections.
