# Notification Manage

Notifications are a relatively “heavy” feature — unlike background tasks such as model running or training that operate with low user awareness, notifications are more about user-to-user interaction. And each user has different preferences for how frequently they want to be notified.

With that in mind, starting from v0.2.5, the notification feature has been decoupled from the core logic to avoid overwhelming some users with excessive notifications.

Now, you can easily integrate the notification system into your own setup through a simple configuration on the settings page.

<div className="grid grid-col grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 w-full mt-5">

</div>

Please note: You need to configure both the notification source and the notification target first.

The notification source refers to the system that sends messages — such as an email server, Lark (Feishu), WeCom (Enterprise WeChat), Apple APNS, or SMS providers. The notification target refers to the receiving endpoint — such as Lark, WeCom, email inboxes, or devices.

Currently, only email sources and email targets are supported, but support for more options will be added soon.
