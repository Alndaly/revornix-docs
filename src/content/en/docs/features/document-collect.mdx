# Document Collection

This system supports multiple types of document sources. Currently, the following are supported: **Website Documents**, **Quick Notes**, and **File Documents**.

<Callout type='warning'>
	Since the current Jina engine only supports website documents, please switch to another conversion engine if you need to process file documents.
</Callout>

There are several ways to collect documents and information. The simplest and most straightforward method is to add documents directly through the web interface.

## Web Collection

### Configuration Description

- **Link**: The website URL you wish to collect.
- **Tags**: Your document tags. You can add multiple tags to facilitate filtering and viewing later.
- **AI Auto Summary**: When enabled, the system will automatically call the AI interface to summarize the document content, replacing the default website title and description.
- **Push to Section**: You can select the section to which you want to push the document. The system will automatically push the document to the selected section and update that column’s summary.

<Callout>
	Note: If you enable AI Auto Summary, your manually configured website title and description will not take effect, as they will be replaced by AI-generated summaries.
</Callout>

## API Collection

To help developers **integrate third-party applications** or **build custom workflows**, Revornix provides an API-based method for document collection.

You can click on the **user avatar** in the bottom left corner, select **Account** to open the account settings page, then go to **API Key Management** and click **Go to Settings** to access the configuration page.

For request parameters and response examples of the API method, please refer to [Third-Party API](./api).
