# Document Collection

This system supports multiple document sources. Currently supported: **website documents**, **quick notes**, and **file documents**、**audio documents**.

<Callout type='warning'>
	The Jina engine currently supports only website documents. If you need file documents, switch the conversion engine to something other than Jina.

There are multiple ways to collect documents and information. The simplest and most direct way is to add a document from the web UI.

## Web collection

### Configuration

- Link: the website URL you want to collect.
- Tags: document tags for later filtering.
- Auto tag: when enabled, AI selects tags from your tag list based on the document content.
- Auto summary: when enabled, the system calls AI to summarize the content and replaces the default website title/description.
- Auto podcast: when enabled, the system generates an audio podcast from the document and attaches it to the document.
- Push to sections: select sections to push to. The system will push the document to those sections and update section summaries.

<Callout>
	Note: if auto summary is enabled, the title and description you set will not take effect and will be replaced by the AI summary.
</Callout>
