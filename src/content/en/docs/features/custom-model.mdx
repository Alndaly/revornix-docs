# Custom Models

The Revornix system supports adding custom third-party models so you can integrate the models you prefer.

<Callout>
Currently, only models that follow the `openai` protocol are supported, meaning third-party models must be compatible with the OpenAI API.

## How to Configure and Add Models

3. Click **Configure Models** on the provider card to enter the model group configuration page. Click **Add Model**, fill in the model name, and then click the **Save** button on the right. The model name must match the exact name of the third-party model; you cannot use a custom name.

## Selecting Custom Models

Users can assign custom models to specific purposes.

<Callout>
By default, the document summarization model not only creates document summaries, generates summaries, titles, descriptions, and sections, but it also participates in building the knowledge graph as the primary model for entity and relationship extraction. We recommend configuring a high-quality model for this role.
