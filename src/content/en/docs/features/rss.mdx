# RSS Subscription

Sometimes users need to keep track of updates on a webpage, such as blogs, videos from a creator, tweets, and so on. Therefore, supporting RSS subscription is a natural requirement.

Starting from version `0.4` and later, the system comes with built-in RSS subscription functionality. You can now quickly add RSS subscription sources by selecting the **RSS** option in the left sidebar menu. In theory, this allows you to subscribe to updates from almost any website.

The system also integrates [RSSHub](https://docs.rsshub.app/zh/) as an RSS feed generator, so all sources supported by this project can be seamlessly integrated into Revornix.

If there are websites you want to add as RSS sources but RSSHub does not support them, you can follow [RSSHubâ€™s official documentation](https://docs.rsshub.app/zh/joinus/) to create and add your own.
