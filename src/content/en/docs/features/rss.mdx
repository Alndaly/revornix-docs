# RSS Subscription

![](https://qingyon-revornix-public.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/images/202508311049845.png)

Sometimes users need to track updates from a webpage, such as blogs, creators' videos, or tweets. So supporting RSS is a natural requirement.

Since the `0.4` series, the system has built-in RSS subscriptions. You can quickly add RSS sources via the RSS item in the left menu. In theory, you can subscribe to updates from any website this way.

The system also embeds [RSSHub](https://docs.rsshub.app/zh/) as a source generator, so any feed supported by RSSHub can be integrated seamlessly.

If you want to add sources for websites not supported by RSSHub, you can implement them based on the [RSSHub docs](https://docs.rsshub.app/zh/joinus/).
