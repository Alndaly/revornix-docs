# Section Sharing & Co-Creation

The section sharing mechanism is one of the core capabilities of the platform. It lets you share section content with specific collaborators or make it fully public. This boosts engagement, encourages collaboration, and helps you promote your knowledge.

## Sharing Methods

You can share a section in two ways:

1. Invite specific users and grant permissions.

Use the **Share** button at the bottom of a section to search for any platform user, choose the assets you want to share, and assign permissions. Three permission levels are available:

- **Full access**: View, edit, and modify the section, plus invite additional collaborators.
- **Read & write**: View and edit the section.
- **Read only**: View content without editing.

<Callout type='warning'>
	Only the section creator can remove collaborators or change their permissions. If someone else invites collaborators, they cannot later adjust or remove those invites.

2. **Publish to the web**: Make the section publicly accessible to promote your work and give the community more to learn from. Once published, the section becomes searchable in the community section list. Outstanding content may also be indexed by search engines over time, extending its reach.

Revornix lets you regenerate a publication URL at any time. Click **Refresh** in the publishing dialog to generate a brand-new link.

## Subscription Mechanism

After a section is published, anyone can view it. Readers can also subscribe with a single click on the **Subscribe** button in the footer.

Subscribed sections appear in the **Subscribed Sections** list on the left navigation bar, making it easy to keep up with updates.

_We plan to add notifications when subscribed sections are updated._

In the **cloud edition**, you will be able to monetize knowledge by setting a section as paid access. Revornix Cloud will charge a **10%** service fee on paid sections.
