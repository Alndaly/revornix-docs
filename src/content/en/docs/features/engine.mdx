# Document Parsing Engines

![](https://qingyon-revornix-public.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/images/20260115162300708.png)

There are four official engines:

| Engine | Supported Types |
| --- | --- |
| MinerU | Web / File |
| MinerU API | Web / File |
| Jina | Web |
| Markitdown | Web / File |

**The official Jina engine currently only supports website documents, not file documents. For file documents, use one of the other three engines.**

The configuration fields appear in the dialog after you click Configure on an installed engine. Set the parameters according to the examples.

For Markitdown, it is recommended to set `openai_api_key` to enable image parsing. Without it, images cannot be parsed. You can apply for an API key at https://openai.com.

MinerU API requires its own API key. See https://mineru.net for the application process.

Jina also requires an API key. See https://jina.ai for the application process.

**If you use MinerU API, note that MinerU does not support requests from non-China IPs. If you encounter errors, check whether a local proxy is enabled and remove `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` if set.**

Install the engine, complete configuration, and then use it for document conversion.
