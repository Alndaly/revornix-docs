Starting from `v0.2.0`, users can choose their document conversion engine instead of being limited to MinerU (files) or Jina (websites). You can find the configuration page under **Settings → Engine Settings**.

Currently, there are three official engines available:

- MinerU  
- Jina  
- Markitdown  

<Callout type="warning">
The Jina engine **does not yet support file document conversion**, only website conversion. So if you’re working with a file type, please set the engine to MinerU or Markitdown.
</Callout>

After clicking to install the corresponding engine, you can proceed with its configuration. Once configured, you can use that engine for document conversion.

Note that the configuration options will appear in a modal below when you click the **Configure** button for an installed engine. You can set parameters based on the provided example.
