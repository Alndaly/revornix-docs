Currently, four official parsing engines are available:

|Engine Name|Supported Types|
|---|---|
|MinerU|Webpages / Files|
|MinerU API|Webpages / Files|
|Jina|Webpages|
|Markitdown|Webpages / Files|

**The currently provided Jina engine only supports webpage parsing, not file conversion. If you're parsing file-type documents, please choose one of the other three engines.**

Note that after clicking the configuration button for an installed engine, the corresponding configuration options will appear at the bottom of the pop-up window. You can follow the example to set the parameters.

It is recommended to set the `openai_api_key` when using the Markitdown engine, especially for parsing image files. Without this key, image parsing will not work. You can apply for the key on the OpenAI official website: https://openai.com

For the MinerU API engine, you will need to apply for an API Key yourself. For detailed instructions, visit the official site: https://mineru.net

Jina also requires an API Key. You can apply for one from the official website: https://jina.ai

**If you are using the MinerU API engine, please note that MinerU officially does not support requests from non-China IPs. If you encounter errors while using this engine, make sure your local proxy is enabled and check whether your local `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables are set. If they are, please remove them.**

Once you've installed the desired engine, you can proceed with the corresponding configuration. After configuration, the engine will be ready for document conversion.
