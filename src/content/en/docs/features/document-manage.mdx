# Document Management

All documents collected in Revornix through various methods can be managed in a unified way.

<Callout>
	Currently, except for Quick Notes, the converted results of all other document sources are essentially markdown files.
</Callout>

## Document Basic Information

![](https://qingyon-revornix-public.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/images/20251010224258922.png)

After a document is collected and converted, its title, description, tags, and columns can all be modified. Any modification will automatically trigger an update of the associated column.

## Document Status

Each document has an independent status. You can freely switch between **read** and **unread** states. The system also supports **favorites** and **tagging**, making it easier to organize and view documents later.

You can also view the processing progress of a document, including **embedding progress** and **knowledge graph construction progress**.

Document type and source information are also available.

By default, all new documents are marked as **Unread** (including self-edited Quick Notes).

Currently, Revornix supports the following ways to change document status:

- Enter the document detail page  
- Scroll to the bottom of the document detail page  
- Manually mark the document

## Document Viewing

![](https://qingyon-revornix-public.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/images/20251010224517049.png)

You can view documents by different states or view all documents together. Filtering by tags is also supported.

Supports **exact search** by document title and content (based on Postgres queries), as well as **global fuzzy search** (based on Milvus).

Documents can be sorted in **ascending or descending order** by time.

## Document Storage

Document storage is divided into several components:

| Data Type                                             | Storage Location                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Document metadata                                     | Postgres                                |
| Document files (e.g., original file / converted markdown) | [Custom File System](./custom-file-system) |
| Document embeddings (after vectorization)             | Milvus                                  |
| Document knowledge graph information                  | Neo4j                                   |

<Callout>
	For efficiency reasons, the default document embedding model is `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B`.  
	If you need higher-quality embeddings, you can modify the source code accordingly.  
	In future versions, this will be decoupled so users can freely choose their own model.
</Callout>

## AI Auto Summarization

You can configure a model (in the settings page) to allow the system to automatically summarize document content and replace the default website title and description.

<Callout type='warning'>
	Note: If you enable auto summarization, the manually configured title and description of the document will be overwritten.  
	This is the current default behavior of the AI summarization feature.
</Callout>

## Document Notes

![](https://qingyon-revornix-public.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/images/20251010225530879.png)

You can add supplemental notes to your documents to make it easier to review them later.

## Document Knowledge Graph

![](https://qingyon-revornix-public.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/images/20251010225439549.png)

You can use the document knowledge graph button at the bottom right to view the key knowledge points contained in the document and the relationships between them.
