## Document Collection

There are various ways to collect documents and information. The simplest and most straightforward way is through the website interface to add documents.

### Website Collection

#### Configuration Instructions

- Link: The URL of the website you want to collect
- Tags: Tags for your document. You can add multiple tags to facilitate filtering and searching later
- AI Auto Summary: When enabled, the system will automatically call the AI API to summarize the document content and replace the default website title and description
- Push to Column: You can choose a column to push the document to. The system will automatically push the document into the selected column and update its summary

### API Collection

The current version supports collecting documents via API.

You can access this feature by clicking your user info at the bottom left of the app page -> Account to open your account settings, then choose Developer APIKey to configure it.

For detailed request parameters and response examples, see [Third-Party API](./api)
