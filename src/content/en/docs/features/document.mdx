## Document Status

Each document has its own independent status. You can freely switch between `read` and `unread`. You can also bookmark or tag documents for easier organization and later reference.

By default, newly created documents are marked as `unread` (this includes quick notes you’ve edited yourself).

## Document Viewing

You can view documents by individual status or view all documents together. Filtering by tags is also supported.

Precise search on document titles and content is supported (based on Postgres queries), along with global fuzzy search (powered by Milvus).

Sorting by time is also supported.

## Document Storage

Currently, we have already support the custom file system, you can check the detail in [custom file system](./custom-file-system). At the same time, vectorized versions of the documents are stored in Milvus using embedding technology. This supports global search and AI-powered interactions.

## Smart Summary

You can configure a model (via the settings page) to enable automatic summarization of document content. The system will then replace the default site title, description, and other metadata with the generated summary.
