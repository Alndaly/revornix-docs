# Daily Section

To organize knowledge by date for easier review, I created this section type.

Note: there is currently no way to disable the Daily Section for document creation. All documents you create will be automatically added to the Daily Section.
</Callout>

This is a special section type that does not require manual configuration. The system updates it automatically based on your document collection activity.

In other words, when you create the first document on a new day, the system automatically creates a Daily Section, adds the document to it, and then generates the summary analysis.

This feature is tied to **notifications**. I also created a Daily Summary notification template that you can configure in the notification tasks page so users receive the summary at their chosen time.
