	There is currently no way to disable automatic ingestion. Every document you create is added to Today’s Section.

This special section type requires no manual setup; the system keeps it updated based on your document activity.

Whenever you create the first document of a new day, the system creates (or refreshes) Today’s Section, adds the document, and generates a summary analysis.

Today’s Section ties into **notifications**. A dedicated notification template is available so you can send the daily summary at a time you choose from the notification task page.
