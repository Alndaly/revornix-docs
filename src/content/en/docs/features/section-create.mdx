# Section Creation

![](https://qingyon-revornix-public.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/images/20251019124934212.png)

Creating a standard section is straightforward—click **Create** next to **Section** in the left navigation.

Some section types, such as **Today’s Section**, do not require manual configuration. As soon as you add documents, the system generates the section and keeps it updated by blending existing summaries with new content.

<Callout>
	Today’s Section cannot be disabled. Every document you add is automatically included for analysis and summarization.

You can also create sections through the API—see the [Section creation endpoint](./api/#tpsectioncreate) for details. The Revornix npm and pip packages expose the same capabilities; refer to their documentation on GitHub: [Revornix-Npm-Lib](https://github.com/Qingyon-AI/Revornix-Npm-Lib) and [Revornix-Python-Lib](https://github.com/Qingyon-AI/Revornix-Python-Lib).
