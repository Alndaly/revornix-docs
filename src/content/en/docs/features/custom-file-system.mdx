# Custom File System

Starting from version `v0.3.0-beta1`, support for custom file systems has been added. You can use a custom file system to store your files instead of the default one.

By configuring a custom file system, you can choose Alibaba Cloud OSS, Amazon S3, or the built-in MinIO service as your file storage system.

Please note that when you update the file system, files from the previous system will not be automatically migrated to the new file systemâ€”you need to migrate them manually.
