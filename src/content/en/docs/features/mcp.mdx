# MCP

> MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. You can think of MCP as the USB-C port for AI applications. Just like USB-C provides a standardized way to connect devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP offers a standardized way to connect AI models with different data sources and tools.

Starting from `v0.1.0`, the MCP client has been integrated natively. You can easily configure MCP servers via the MCP Management section in Settings.

Currently, only Stream MCP and Std MCP types are supported.

From `v0.1.0` onwards, a new `mcp-server` project group has been added. This group includes many commonly used built-in MCP servers (including some that interact with your document libraries), which you can use directly.

Once the MCP server is successfully configured, Revornix AI can interact with you using your entire tool library.
