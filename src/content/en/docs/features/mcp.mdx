# MCP

> MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. You can think of MCP as the USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect devices with peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

For better tool calling, use a base model that follows instructions well.

In `v0.1.0` and later, an MCP client is integrated internally. You can easily configure MCP servers via MCP Management in Settings.

Currently only Stream MCP and Std MCP are supported.

After MCP servers are configured, Revornix AI can chat with you based on your entire tool library.

### Developer note

If you plan to develop your own `mcp server`, put the code under the `api/mcp_router` project group. See the `common` and `document` examples in that folder.
