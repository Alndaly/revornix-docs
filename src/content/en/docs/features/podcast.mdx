To provide more ways to produce knowledge, Revornix offers podcast generation.

## Configure the engine

Before using this feature, configure your podcast generation engine in Settings. Currently supported: ByteDance Volcengine's podcast model and OpenAI Chat Completions multimodal audio models (for example, [`gpt-audio`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-audio)).

Using Volcengine as an example, you can register on the [Volcengine console](https://console.volcengine.com/speech/app) and obtain your AppID and Access Token.

1. Go to the [Volcengine console](https://console.volcengine.com/speech/app) and click Create App.
2. Fill in the configuration. Make sure to select the Doubao voice podcast model in the capability options, then click Confirm.

3. Click the Doubao voice podcast model on the left, select your newly created app on the right, and enable the service.

4. After the service is enabled, you can see your AppID and Access Token and token usage. Volcengine currently gives 1,000,000 free tokens, which does not go very far in practice, so use them sparingly.
5. In Revornix, open Settings, go to the engine configuration page, select the ByteDance podcast engine, fill in the AppID and Access Token, and click Save.
