The column feature was designed to make it easier to integrate knowledge bases and facilitate knowledge management for users.

The subscription feature also better supports the dissemination of knowledge bases.

A **cloud version** will be launched in the future, which will include paid subscriptions. This design aims to provide monetization opportunities for knowledge creators - users can pay to subscribe to columns, authors can earn income from subscriptions, and the platform will charge a 10% service fee.

## Creation

Currently, there is only one way to create columns - through the website interface. API creation is not yet supported.

### Website Creation

After entering the Revornix application, there is a creation entry to the right of the "Columns" text in the expanded left sidebar. Click to enter the creation page.
