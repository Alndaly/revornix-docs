# Column

<Callout type='info'>
	The column feature is currently in Beta and still unstable. Significant changes may occur in the future.
</Callout>

The column feature is designed to better integrate the knowledge base, helping users with **knowledge summarization, absorption, and sharing**.

At the same time, the subscription feature enhances the distribution of knowledge bases.

A **cloud version** will be launched later, which will support paid subscriptions. The goal is to help monetize knowledge content: users can pay to subscribe to columns, and authors can **earn revenue** through subscriptions. The platform will charge a **10%** service fee.

## Today's Column

This is a special type of column that requires no user configuration and is automatically generated. Users only need to add documents to Revornix. Specifically, when a user creates their first document of the day, the system will automatically create a "Today’s Column", add the document to it, and then generate a summary and analysis.

The core purpose is to organize knowledge chronologically for easier review.

Columns are tightly integrated with the **notification feature**. A notification template for daily summaries has been prepared. You can configure this template directly on the Notification Tasks page, so users will receive the summary at a preset time.

## Document Binding

Columns are considered a **specific knowledge collection**. The idea behind columns is to make **summarizing, absorbing, and sharing** knowledge easier.

Therefore, columns are tightly bound to documents. Once a document is linked to a column, it will automatically appear in that column, and the column will automatically appear in the document.

_Columns will later embed GraphRAG to help visualize the knowledge graph of the collection._

## Sharing and Subscription

Columns can be set to public. Public columns will appear in the column community where users can browse and subscribe.

_In the future, when a subscribed column is updated, subscribers will receive notifications._

In the **cloud version**, there will be paid column support. Users can monetize their knowledge by setting their columns as paid. Revornix Cloud will charge a **10%** service fee.

## Viewing Columns

- Supports filtering by column tags.
- Users can view their own columns, community columns, and columns they've subscribed to.
