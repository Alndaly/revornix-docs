# Quick Start

You can join our WeChat group <WeComCode /> for communication.

## Docker Method (Recommended)

<Steps>

### Clone the Repository Locally

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Qingyon-AI/Revornix.git
cd Revornix
```

### Environment Variable Configuration

```shell
cp ./envs/.api.env.example ./envs/.api.env
cp ./envs/.file.env.example ./envs/.file.env
cp ./envs/.celery.env.example ./envs/.celery.env
cp ./envs/.hot.env.example ./envs/.hot.env
```

Go to the corresponding environment variable files for configuration, see [Environment Variable Configuration Chapter](environment) for details.

Add the following file in the web subdirectory to configure frontend environment variables. Remember to modify `<http/https>://<your host>` to your actual service address. For example, if you are using local, then it should be http://localhost.

```shell filename=".env"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PREFIX='<http/https>://<your host>/api/main-service'
NEXT_PUBLIC_NOTIFICATION_WS_API_PREFIX='<ws/wss>://<your host>/api/main-service/notification/'
NEXT_PUBLIC_FILE_API_PREFIX='<http/https>://<your host>/api/file-service'
NEXT_PUBLIC_DAILY_HOT_API_PREFIX='<http/https>://<your host>/api/daily-hot-service'
```

### Pull Necessary Repositories with Docker and Start

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

After all services have started, visit http://localhost to see the frontend page. Note that because the backend services take longer to start, the frontend may need to wait for a period of time (normally about 3-5 minutes) before it can make normal API requests. You can check the core backend service startup status with `docker compose logs api`.

</Steps>

## Manual Deployment Method

Unless you need to modify some source code to adapt to custom functionality, this method is not recommended. The process is indeed quite complex.

<Callout>
	It is strongly recommended to use conda to create different Python virtual environments for each service, as Python dependencies between different services may conflict. Of course, if you have other Python virtual environment management tools, you can use those as well.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Clone the Repository Locally

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Qingyon-AI/Revornix.git
cd Revornix
```

### Environment Variable Configuration

```shell
cp ./envs/.api.env.example ./api/.env
cp ./envs/.file.env.example ./file-backend/.env
cp ./envs/.celery.env.example ./celery-worker/.env
cp ./envs/.hot.env.example ./daily-hot/.env
```

Please add the following content to the `./api/.env` and `./file-backend/.env` files:

```
ENV=dev
```

Add the following file in the web subdirectory to configure frontend environment variables:

```shell filename=".env"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PREFIX='http://localhost/api/main-service'
NEXT_PUBLIC_NOTIFICATION_WS_API_PREFIX='ws://localhost/api/main-service/notification/'
NEXT_PUBLIC_FILE_API_PREFIX='http://localhost/api/file-service'
NEXT_PUBLIC_DAILY_HOT_API_PREFIX='http://localhost/api/daily-hot-service'
```

Go to the corresponding environment variable files for configuration, see [Environment Variable Configuration Chapter](environment) for details.

### Initialize Some Necessary Data

```shell
cd api
python -m script.init_vector_base_data
python -m script.init_sql_base_data
```

### Install and Start Basic Services

<Callout>
	If you don't have MySQL, Redis, and Milvus installed, you'll need to manually install these services locally and modify the corresponding parameter configurations in the environment variable files.
	Considering that these are relatively troublesome and unimportant tasks, I've specifically created a `docker-compose-local.yaml` file that you can use directly to download and start these services.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
	Note: If you have already installed some of these services locally, please disable the corresponding service configurations in the `docker-compose-local.yaml` file according to your actual situation, otherwise it may cause some unexpected situations.
</Callout>

```shell
docker compose -f ./docker-compose-local.yaml up -d 
```

### Start Core Backend Service

```shell
cd api
conda create -n api python=3.11 -y
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
fastapi run --port 8001
```

### Start Hot Search Aggregation Service

```shell
cd daily-hot
pnpm i 
pnpm dev
```

### Start File Backend Service

```shell
cd file-backend
conda create -n file-backend python=3.11 -y
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
fastapi run --port 8002
```

### Start Celery Task Sequence

```shell
cd celery-worker
conda create -n celery-worker python=3.11 -y
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
celery -A common.celery.app.celery_app worker --loglevel=info --pool threads
```

### Start Frontend Service

```shell
cd web
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

</Steps>

After you have started all services, visit http://localhost:3000 to see the frontend page.
