# Privacy Policy

This project is an open-source initiative designed to help users manage, collect, and analyze information. We take user privacy and data security very seriously.

### Data Collection

By default, we do **not** collect any personal information from users. The application runs locally and does not actively upload, share, or store user data.

### Permissions

If the project requests any of the following permissions or system capabilities, they are used **solely** for their intended functionality:

- **Network access**: Used to load remote content or API data.  
- **Local storage access**: Used to save user settings or data.  
- **Notification permissions**: Used to send reminder messages to users; not used for data collection.  
- **Microphone/Camera/Location permissions (if applicable)**: Only used for specific features (e.g., audio/video transmission) and never used to collect or store data in the background.

### Third-Party Services

If the project depends on third-party services (such as Firebase, Apple APIs, etc.), please refer to their respective privacy policies. We do **not** send any personal data to third parties without user consent.

### Local Data Storage

All user data is stored locally on the device by default. Users are free to export, modify, or delete their data at any time.

### Open Source Notice

This project is open source, and anyone can view, modify, or deploy the code. We encourage users to self-host and adapt the privacy implementation as needed.
