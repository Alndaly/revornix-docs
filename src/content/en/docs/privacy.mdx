# Privacy Policy

Revornix aims to provide users with a smooth workflow for collecting, analyzing, and sharing information. We take user privacy and data security very seriously. Because Revornix offers both an open-source edition and an official cloud edition, this policy is split into two parts.

> We promise that Revornix will remain open source. You can choose to **self-host** and use nearly all features for free.

## Revornix Open-Source Edition

### Data Collection

As the provider of open-source software, we do not collect any personal information from your users. You retain full control and responsibility for all of your data.

If your user information is leaked, we do not assume any liability.

### Permissions

If the project requests the following permissions or system capabilities, they are used only for the corresponding features:

- Network access: Loads remote content or makes API requests.
- Local storage access: Saves or reads user-defined settings, documents, sections, and similar data.
- Notification permissions: Sends reminder messages. We promise to avoid non-essential notifications. With Revornix’s decoupled notification design, users can decide which notifications to receive and even configure their own notification sources and targets.

### Third-Party Services

Revornix relies on some third-party services (such as model providers, Apple APIs, etc.). Please refer to the privacy policies of those services. We do not proactively send any personal information to third parties without user consent. Note that when using cloud-based large language models, conversations are inevitably sent to the model provider. Please review that provider’s privacy agreement. Users, or authorized Revornix distributors, are obligated to understand and comply with these policies.

### Open Source Notice

Revornix is an open-source project. Anyone can view, modify, or deploy the code. We encourage users to self-host and adjust privacy-related implementations to suit their needs.

## Revornix Official Cloud Edition

Only the root domain `revornix.com` belongs to the official cloud service. Please be cautious when using any other domain. We do not provide privacy protection for versions that are not officially authorized and operated.

### Data Collection

As a cloud service provider, we only collect the following necessary personal information:

- User email: Registration, login, password recovery, etc.
- User IP address: Traffic statistics and abuse prevention.
- User device information: Traffic statistics and notification capabilities.
- User behavior data: Traffic statistics.
- User feedback data: Product improvements.
- User WeChat information: WeChat login, WeChat Pay, and related features.
- User Google information: Google login and related features.
- User GitHub information: GitHub login and related features.
- User mobile number: Mobile login and related features.

### Permissions

If the project requests the following permissions or system capabilities, they are used only for their corresponding features:

- Network access: Loads remote content or makes API requests.
- Local storage access: Saves or reads user-defined settings, documents, sections, and similar data.
- Notification permissions: Sends reminder messages. We promise to avoid non-essential notifications. With Revornix’s decoupled notification design, users can decide which notifications to receive and even configure their own notification sources and targets.

### Third-Party Services

Revornix depends on certain third-party services (such as model providers, Apple APIs, etc.). Please refer to each provider’s privacy policy. We do not proactively send any personal information to third parties without user consent. Note that when using cloud-based large language models, conversations are inevitably sent to the model provider, and you should consult their privacy agreement. Users are responsible for understanding and complying with these privacy policies. Revornix’s official cloud edition does not assume any liability for privacy issues related to such third-party services.
