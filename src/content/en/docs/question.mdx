# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is an Nginx service needed when using Docker?

Initially, I didn’t include an Nginx service. However, when accessing the API deployed via Docker directly from the browser, it often fails — mainly because the host doesn’t actually exist on your machine. Even if it does, due to Docker’s nature, the internal IP of the service may change after a restart. So after careful consideration, I added an Nginx service as a proxy to ensure stable access.

### Why do the web service environment variables need special configuration?

Because of certain Next.js limitations, the web service can’t access environment variables passed via env_file during the Docker Compose build process.

### Is the product free?

The open-source version will always be free, but it does not include commercial support. Please make sure to strictly follow our open-source license when using it. The cloud version, however, is subscription-based.

### How can I get commercial support?

Feel free to add me on WeChat. My WeChat ID is: Kinda0412.

### Can I use this as my note-taking app?

Absolutely! I warmly welcome users to use this as their note-taking app. Just keep in mind that the product is still under active development, so there may be some bugs. You’ll need to use it at your own risk and make regular backups! (At this stage, it’s best for testing and exploration. I don’t recommend using it as your main productivity tool until the official v1.0.0 release.)

### Will there be a desktop version?

The current roadmap includes web, iOS, WeChat Mini Program, and WeChat customer service interfaces. A desktop version is not planned at this time.

### What’s the difference between the open-source and cloud versions?

They’re nearly identical. The core differences are:

- The cloud version requires zero setup — just register and use
- The cloud version offers commercial support
- The cloud version provides monetization features
