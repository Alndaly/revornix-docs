# Overall Architecture

## Services

	Since it's still in the early development phase, the service architecture may undergo significant changes at any time.

- `web`: Frontend
- `api`: Handles all core and basic requests, including document creation/deletion, column creation/deletion, etc.
- `celery-worker`: Handles all background tasks, including notification sending, vectorization, transcoding, data synchronization, data cleanup, etc.
- `file-backend`: File server that stores all document and column information
- `daily-hot`: Hot search aggregation service. Note this service is entirely based on [DailyHotApi](https://github.com/imsyy/DailyHotApi), thanks to the original author [imsyy](https://github.com/imsyy) for their contribution.

## Packaging

The project uses `docker-compose` for packaging, with the configuration located in `docker-compose.yaml`.
